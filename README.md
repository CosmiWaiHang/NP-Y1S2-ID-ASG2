# Interactive Development Assignment 2 Anime Gacha Game

<!-- One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch. -->

For this project, we created a gacha game where players can summon either 1x or 10x to collect characters based on the award-winning anime Attack on Titan. Users can top up a wallet for the in game currency to spend on summons. We want to allow users to have fun collecting their favourite characters through an aspect of suspense through the gacha system.
 
## Design Process
 
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

This website was built for fans of anime/Attack on Titan. The aim is to convey excitement and joy through them playing the game. Users can collect these characters as a sort of collectible and play to get their favourite ones. Our game allows them to do so.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

- As an anime fan, I want to collect characters so that I can have more enjoyment.
- As a working adult, I have more capital to play the game 
longer so I can collect more characters.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process.

Wireframes in Adobe XD - 

These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url. 

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users to move to sections of the webpage by having them click on buttons at the top of the screen, the navigation bar
- Feature 2 - When viewing on a smaller device like a mobile phone, the navigation bar would collpase into a single menu button. When clicked, options to select where you want to be at on the webpage would be automatically transitioned to the selected page smoothly for the user.
- Feature 3 - allows users to summon either 1x or 10x in the summoning page of the website.
- Feature 4 - allows users to view the description and an image of the character categorised by name
- Feature 5 - a statistics page to display the gacha rates visually for ease of understanding

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Use of a more expansive api for greater engagement and viewing pleasure for the user.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Log in Page:
    1. Go to the "Log in Page" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid username or password and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
